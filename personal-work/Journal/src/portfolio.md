	```
  - ```
     URL GameOverUrl = new URL("http://themushroomkingdom.net/sounds/wav/smb/smb_gameover.wav");

# Self Reflections

	 I learned that in my cit 360 class I will not be learning new software programming languages which I am kinda bummed about, but I found out that our class structure is setup a lot like a professor I had last semester, which is great because from my experience I have learned and grown a lot from that structure. And I’m just excited to see more of it.﻿

	This weeks main objective was to create an app to help with possible problems in your daily life. I had a lot of time to think about things that I could develop and other possible ideas —  apps  such as Budget App, Parenting Solutions, Conversion app, Chess game etc. But I wasn’t in love or fully committed to any one of my ideas that I came up with until, I was talking to my friend about our kids and how hard it was to entertain them. While we were discussing this I was blowing bubbles with my daughter and to see her squeal and laugh every time a bubble lands on her. Then it hit me why not make a Bubble App ( bubble blast )?

	  What I got out of this week was not just an idea for my homework assignment but a little bit of wisdom as well.

	Word of wisdom :  " good ideas do not come by force, but by experience  ".﻿

	This week I met with my group, and we discussed and went over our objectives in our first meeting and than assigned each other lists from the topic and resources section. I really enjoyed hanging out with them I generally dont get paired with people who are hard and very focus workers. What I notice in all my years of group projects is that first meetings are pretty tough, because its generally going to be about how we collaborate? what programs are we going to be using? what time do you guys want to meet? and collecting contact info. So the majority or all the time is wasted on this depending on how focus the team are in answering these questions.  (luckily for us this was not the case.)﻿

	This week has been very informational. Learning on what this class needs, and what should be due. I am working with my group to get things done for our portfolio. A question i want to ask the class is, for you sandbox code or for your topics and resources are you basing them off of your projects? or something else?﻿

- May 23

	This week I talked with a professor about java collections, he was great at explaining what java collections is and an example of it ( it helps that this particular professor help wrote the recent Java book)  Also My group created an appointment on monday where we are going to cover all topics and resources to help get ahead of this class. ﻿

	I learned an important lesson today. Which is "save what you can do today for tomorrow" is not a good moral code you should live by. As many of you guys have known from my last weekly reflection was that my group started a hackathon. during that time we recorded many videos in which I told my self I need to create links and time stamps for myself. Now that a couple of days passed I forgotten everything that I did for the hackathon and now im lost.. Lesson learned.. I can also apply this to my daily life as well. so new moral code " DO today so that you can not forget about it tomorrow"

	life is like a box of chocolates you dont know what you will get until you dive into it. Just like this class you do not know what you will get out of this class until you dive into it and actually learn for yoruself. this week I did just that topics and resources I feel like i know a lot about java and collections..however hibranate still confuses me. can anyone help me understand it? or maybe show me a simple example of how hibranate works?﻿

	Wow the semester has gone by so quickly I love it. Today I spent my days trying to figure out java, still a little confuse on when I should create packages and when shouldnt I . Or when I should use threading but thats all in the past. I created this cool Mini Tennis game that covers 3 topics: Threading , MVC Pattern , and URL Connection so if you want to see it just go to my git hub account lylerpalagar  or https://github.com/lyleRpalagar/cit-360-objp2/tree/master/personal-work/mini_tennis﻿

	Hey guys so this week has been awesome I have done a lot of topics and resources Threading, MVC, and Hibernate. I found a little bit about myself which is , if i dont take a break and enjoy the day I will miss out on everything life has to offer.. and example of that for me was my little 8 month old has just started to stand upright by herself.. Yea ! she  would crawl up to a couch and use it as leverage to pull herself up and than she would take one hand off and put it in the air and then smile at whoever saw it. ....Almost missed that.
