#### Summary
The mini tennis game, is a olden style pong type of game, I found an excellent helper tutorial on the subject so I wanted to try it out. We build 3 seperate classes that all connects to the game.java which will run our repaint(), frame() , and our sound.

The mini project covers

1.) MVC - which is shown in my folder tree 
2.) Threading - which is shown on the game.java line   113 
3.) URL CONNECTION - to play .wav songs over on someone elses server which is shown on line 78,83,87
